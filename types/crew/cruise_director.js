//   It may seem a little overwhelming at first, but together we'll explore your new ship.`,

//   traveling: `Let's talk about traveling. Traveling is an essential part of the game. There are 11 ports, across 9 different continents that you can visit.
//   Once you arrive in port, some of your guests/passengers will disembark (get off) your ship, but not to worry as new guests will embark (board) your ship. You will also receive some ${KORONA} (in-game currency) for each guest that joins

//   Traveling occers in real time, that means when it says it is going to take 48 hours for you to reach your destination, it really will take you 2 days to sail there. Just like on a real cruise ship, once you are sailing, the real fun begins.

//   You will notice that while you are sailing, your Deck Plan will have different options that were not previously available to you. For example, The 'casino' is only available while you are sailing`,

//   casino: `The casino is a great place to win some ${KORONA}, play against other players in a game of Lowest-Highest or try your luck on the emoji slots.`,
